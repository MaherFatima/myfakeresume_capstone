    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>I am a goal-driven, computer software engineer. In my academic years, I solved several real-world computer science problems, and I am now working as an independent consultant to help clients address business challenges through software engineering. 
        I am proficient in a number of programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and C++, which I self-taught. I am always eager to meet with other software engineers and learn more, so please do not hesitate to connect with me!</p>
